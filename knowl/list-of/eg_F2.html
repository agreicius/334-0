<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(F=\{a,b\}\)</span> be a set containing two distinct elements. Define addition and multiplication on <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> as follows:</div>

<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> only has two elements, showing that Axioms (i)-(iii) hold is a simple matter of looking at all the possible cases: in other words, we can resort to a proof by exhaustion for these axioms. For example, verifying commutativity of multiplication requires looking at just 4 different cases. Furthermore, since it is trivially true that <span class="process-math">\(a a=aa\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(bb=bb\text{,}\)</span> we need only look at the “mixed products” <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(ba\text{;}\)</span> and in this case we see by the definition that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
ab=a=ba\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Similar arguments can be mounted for the rest of these arithmetic axioms.</div>
</div>
<div class="para">We now turn to the existential axioms. First, we claim that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> serves as the additive identity in this case: i.e., we have <span class="process-math">\(0=a\)</span> for this field. To verify this, we need to show that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> satisfies the defining axiom of the additive identity: namely, that <span class="process-math">\(a+\alpha=\alpha\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\in F\text{.}\)</span> But this follows directly from the very definition of addition on <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> as we declared that <span class="process-math">\(a+a=a\)</span> and<span class="process-math">\(a+b=b\text{.}\)</span> A similar argument shows that the element <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> acts as the multiplicative identity in this field: i.e., we have <span class="process-math">\(1=b\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Lastly we must show that each element of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> has an additive inverse satisfying Axiom (v), and that each nonzero element of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> has a multiplicative inverse satisfying Axiom (vii). Again, this is accomplished simply by inspection, building on our already established result that <span class="process-math">\(a=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b=1\text{.}\)</span> In detail, since <span class="process-math">\(a+a=a=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b+b=a=0\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(-a=a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-b=b\text{.}\)</span> Turning at last to multiplicative inverses, note first that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is the only nonzero element of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(a=0\)</span>). Furthermore, since <span class="process-math">\(bb=b=1\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(b^{-1}=b\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Since the operations on <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> satisfy the field axioms, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is a field with respect to these operations. Having identified <span class="process-math">\(a=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b=1\text{,}\)</span> we can summarize the arithemetic rules of this particular field as follows:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
0+0 \amp =0 \amp 0+1\amp=1+0=1 \amp 1+1\amp =0 \\
0\cdot 0 \amp = 0 \amp 0\cdot 1\amp =1\cdot 0=0 \amp 1\cdot 1\amp =1\\
-0 \amp =0 \amp -1\amp =1 \amp 1^{-1}\amp =1\text{.}
