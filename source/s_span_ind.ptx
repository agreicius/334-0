    <title>Span and linear independence</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
      There are many situations in mathematics where we want to describe an infinite set in a concise manner. We saw this at work already in <xref ref="s_solving"/>, where infinite sets of solutions to linear systems were neatly described with parametric expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar issue arises when describing vector spaces and their subspaces. As we know, any vector space is either the zero space or infinite (<xref ref="ex_vs_zero_or_infinite"/>). If we happen to be dealing with a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>, then there is the possibility of giving a parametric description; but how do we proceed when working in one of our more exotic vector spaces like <m>C^1(\R)</m>?
    </p>
    <p>
    As we will see in the next section the relevant linear algebraic tool for this purpose is the concept of a <em>basis</em>. Loosely speaking, a basis for a vector space <m>V</m> is a set of vectors that is large enough to <em>generate</em> the entire space, and small enough to contain <em>no redundancies</em>. What exactly we mean by <q>generate</q> is captured by the rigorous notion of <em>span</em>; and what we mean by <q>no redundancies</q> is captured by <em>linear independence</em>.

    <title>Span</title>
    <p>
        In a nutshell we will define the span of a tuple <m>(v_i)_{i\in I}</m> of vectors to be the set of all linear combinations of those vectors. Since we allow the index set <m>I</m> of a tuple to be arbitrary (and possibly infinite), we need to first make proper sense of what a linear combination of <m>(v_i)_{i\in I}</m> is. We do so with the following somewhat technical definition. 
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="d_lin_comb_tuple">
    <title>Linear combination of a tuple</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>V</m> be an <m>F</m>-vector space, and let <m>(v_i)_{i\in I}</m> be a tuple of elements of <m>V</m>. A <term>linear combination</term> of the vectors <m>v_i</m> is an expression of the form 
    <men xml:id="eq_lin_comb_tuple">
        \sum_{i\in I}c_iv_i
    </men>,
    where <m>c_i\in I</m> for all <m>i</m>, and <m>c_i=0</m> for all but finitely many <m>i\in I</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Given a linear combination <m>\sum_{i\in I}c_iv_i</m>, letting <m>c_{i_1},c_{i_2},\dots, c_{i_n}</m> be the set of nonzero coefficients, we define 
        <me>
            \sum_{i\in I}c_iv_i=c_{i_1}v_{i_1}+c_{i_2}v_{i_2}+\cdots+c_{i_n}v_{i_n}
        </me>.
    </p>
    </statement>
    </definition>
    <remark>
    <title>Linear combination of tuples</title>
    <p>
        For the most part we will be dealing with <m>n</m>-tuples of vectors, where the index set <m>I=\{1,2,\dots, n\}</m>. In this special case, the <q>for all but finitely many</q> condition is automatic, making <xref ref="d_lin_comb_tuple"/> is very straightforward: a linear combination of a tuple <m>(v_1,v_2,\dots, v_n)</m> is just a vector of the form 
        <me>
            c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\cdots +c_nv_n
        </me>,
        where <m>c_i\in F</m>.
