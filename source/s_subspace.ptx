    <introduction>
        <p>
      In this section we will study <xref ref="d_subspace" text="custom">subspaces</xref>, which are special subsets of vector spaces that <em>respect</em> the defining structure of a vector spaces: namely, the two vector operations. <xref ref="d_subspace"/> makes precise what we mean here by <sq>respect</sq>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Subspaces arise naturally in any setting where vector spaces are at play, and are closely connected to solutions to linear systems. As we will see in <xref ref="th_subspace_vectorspace"/>, subspaces of vector spaces are vector spaces in their own right, furnishing us with yet more interesting examples of vector spaces.

<proof>
    <p>
    It is important to understand how <xref first="d_subspace_zero" last="d_subspace_mult">Axioms</xref> of <xref ref="d_subspace"/> come into play here. Without them we would not be able to say that restricting the vector operations of <m>V</m> to elements of <m>W</m> actually gives rise to well-defined operations on <m>W</m>. To be well-defined the operations must output elements that lie not just in <m>V</m>, but in <m>W</m> itself. This is precisely what being closed under addition and scalar multiplication guarantees. In more detail, since <m>\boldw_1+\boldw_2\in W</m> for all <m>w_1,w_2\in W</m> (Axiom (ii)), the vector addition on <m>V</m> gives rise by restriction to a well-defined operation on <m>W</m>; similarly, since <m>c\boldw\in W</m> for all <m>c\in \R</m> and <m>\boldw\in W</m>, the scalar multiplication operation on <m>V</m> gives rise by restriction to a well-defined scalar multiplication on <m>W</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we know restriction gives rise to well-defined operations on <m>W</m>, verifying the <m>arithmetic axioms</m> of  <xref ref="d_vector_space"/> amounts simply to observing that if a condition is true for all <m>v</m> in <m>V</m>, it is certainly true for all <m> v</m> in the subset <m>W</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <q>existential axioms</q> (iii) and (iv) of <xref ref="d_vector_space"/>, however, require special consideration. By definition, a subspace <m>W</m> contains the zero vector of <m>V</m>, and clearly this still acts as the zero vector when we restrict the vector operations to <m>W</m>. What about vector inverses? We know that for any <m> v\in W</m> there is a vector inverse <m>- v</m> lying somewhere in <m>V</m>. We must show that in fact <m>- v</m> lies in <m>W</m>: <ie /> we need to show that the operation of taking the vector inverse is well-defined on <m>W</m>. We prove this as follows:
    <md>
    <mrow> v\in W \amp\implies (-1) v\in W \amp (<xref ref="d_subspace"/>, \text{(iii) } )</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp\implies - v\in W \amp (<xref ref="th_vs_props"/>, (iii)) </mrow>
    </md>.

    <p>
      We can merge conditions (ii)-(iii) of <xref ref="d_subspace"/> into a single statement about linear combinations, deriving the following two-step method for proving that a set <m>W</m> is a subspace of a vector space <m>V</m>.
    <ol marker="i">
      <li xml:id="proc_subspace_zero">
        <p>
          Show <m>\boldzero\in W</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li xml:id="proc_subspace_ops">
        <p>
          Show that
          <me>
           v_1,  v_2\in W\implies c v_1+d v_2\in W
          </me>,
          for all <m>c,d\in F</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
</algorithm>
<p>
  If <m>W</m> is a subspace of a vector space <m>V</m>, then it <em>inherits</em> a vector space structure from <m>V</m> by simply  <em>restricting</em> the vector operations defined on <m>V</m> to the subset <m>W</m>.
