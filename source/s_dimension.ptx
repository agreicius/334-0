    <title>Dimension</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
          Intuitively, we think of <m>\R^2</m> as a two-dimensional space, and <m>\R^3</m> as three-dimensional one. Why? Loosely speaking this notion of dimension has something to do with the number of degrees of freedom involved in specifying a particular element of the given space: to specify an element of <m>\boldv\in \R^2</m> we need to give its two coordinates; to specify an element of <m>\R^3</m> we need to give its three coordinates. Clearly, this conception is too imprecise to serve as a mathematical definition. What exactly does <q>degrees of freedom</q> mean? And how do you quantify the number of <q>degrees of freedom</q> needed for a given space? For example, we also think of a plane <m>W\subseteq \R^3</m> passing through the origin as a two-dimensional object; it is not immediately clear how to square this intuition with our vague <q>degrees of freedom</q> formulation. In this section we introduce the definition of the <em>dimension</em> of a vector space, which will be a rigorous expression of these notions. Our definition, which relies on the concept of bases, seems simple enough: the dimension of a vector space <m>V</m> is defined as the number of elements contained in any basis <m>B</m> of <m>V</m>. However, as we will see there is  considerable work involved (a) in proving that this definition is well-defined, and (b) in showing that it captures the intuition of dimension described above.

    <title>Definition and examples</title>
    <p>
        In the previous section we differentiated between finite- and infinite-dimensional vector spaces. We now elaborate on this classification by assigning to a finite-dimensional vector space a specific integer value called its <em>dimension</em>.

            Let <m>V</m> be a vector space. The <term>dimension of <m>V</m></term>, denoted <m>\dim V</m>, is defined as follows:
            <ul>

                    <p>
                        If <m>V</m> is infinite dimensional, then <m>\dim V=\infty</m>, as before.

        <title>Is dimension well-defined?</title>
        <p>
            The statement of <xref ref="d_dimension"/> is elegant in its simplicity, but a very serious question immediately arises: is this definition well defined? In other words, do any two bases of a vector space have the same length? Who's to say that a vector space <m>V</m> cannot have one basis of length two and another of length 5: or worse, one basis that is finite and another that is infinite? As we will see shortly, any two bases of a finite-dimensional space do indeed have the same length. But first we illustrate our definition with some familiar examples. 
        </p>
      </remark>
      <p>
        By definition, to show a vector space <m>V</m> has dimension <m>n</m>, we must exhibit a basis <m>B</m> with <m>\len B=n</m>. Similarly, to show <m>V</m> is infinite dimensional, we must show that it does not have a finite basis: or equivalently, using <xref ref="cor_finite_dim"/>, we must produce an infinite linearly independent tuple. Let's codify this with a procedure.

        It is especially easy to carry out <xref ref="proc_dimension"/> for a vector space when we have a basis <m>B</m> at the ready. This is the case for our list of familiar vector spaces, each of which is equipped with a standard basis. 
      </p>
      <example xml:id="eg_dimension_familiar">
        <title>Dimensions of familiar spaces</title>

      <li>
        <title>Zero space</title>
        <p>

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Tuples</title>
        <p>
        The tuple <m>B=(\bolde_1, \bolde_2,\dots, \bolde_n)</m> is a basis of <m>F^n</m>. Thus <m>\dim V=\len B=n</m>.

        <title>Polynomials of bounded degree</title>
        <p>
          Let <m>I</m> be an infinite subset of <m>F</m>. The tuple <m>B=(1,x,\dots, x^n)</m> is a basis of <m>P_n(I)</m>. Thus <m>\dim P_n(I)=\len B=n+1</m>.

    Even when we do not have a standard basis at our disposal, there are many situations when we can produce a basis of a space by inspection, allowing us to then easily compute the dimension.

      Having illustrated the definition at work with some familiar examples, we now get down to the business of showing that our definition of dimension is well-defined. The ensuing investigation will reveal a number of useful properties of dimension as it relates to bases and subspaces of vector spaces. Our first result not only ensures that our definition of dimension (<xref text="global" ref="d_dimension"/>) is well-defined, it also characterizes dimension as the minimal length of a spanning set, and the maximal length of a linearly independent tuple.

                Since <m>I</m> is finite, so too is the set <m>\mathcal{P}(I)</m> of all subsets <m>J</m> of <m>I</m>: in fact, we have <m>\mathcal{P}(I)=2^n</m>.

                        The procedure must halt. Why? Since <m>\dim V=n</m>, and since each <m>S_i</m> is linearly independent, we must have <m>\len S_i\leq n</m> for all <m>i</m> by <xref ref="th_basis_dimension"/>. Since <m>\len S_i=m+i</m>, the procedure must halt in at most <m>i=n-m</m> steps.

Furthermore, since the procedure halts at <m>S_k</m>, we know that <m>\Span S_k=V</m>. It follows that <m>B=S_k</m> is a basis containing <m>S</m>, as desired.

        The following corollary follows from <xref ref="th_basis_dimension"/> and <xref ref="th_basis_contract_expand"/>. We call it a <q>street smarts</q> result as the first two statements give us a quick and dirty way of dashing a tuple's hopes of being a basis. The third statement asserts that when a finite set's cardinality matches the dimension of a space, then to prove it is a basis it suffices to prove either one of the two defining properties of <xref ref="d_basis"/>.

            Statements (1) and (2) follow directly from <xref ref="th_basis_dimension"/>. Statement (3) is an easy consequence of <xref ref="th_basis_contract_expand"/>. For example, if <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, then there is a subset <m>S'</m> of <m>S</m> that is a basis of <m>V</m>; since all bases of <m>V</m> have <m>n</m> elements, and since <m>\len =n</m>, we must have <m>S'=S</m>; thus <m>S</m> is a basis. The proof for a linear independent set <m>S</m> is similar, and is left to the reader.

        We are often in a situation where we wish to show a given subspace of a vector space is in fact the entire space. For example, when deciding whether a set <m>S</m> spans a vector space <m>V</m>, we are asking whether <m>W=\Span S</m> is all of <m>V</m>. As the next result illustrates, dimension is a very useful tool in this regard.

Since <m>W\subseteq V</m>, and since <m>\dim V=n</m>, the linearly independent tuples <m>S_i</m> must satisfy <m>i=\len S_i\leq n</m>.
