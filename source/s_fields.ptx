    <introduction>
        <p>
            Most <em>first courses</em> in linear algebra restrict their attention to vector spaces of the form <m>V=\R^n</m>. This is an example of a so-called <em>real vector space</em> (or <em><m>\R</m>-vector space</em>, or <em>vector space over the base field <m>\R</m></em>), and one of a very particular sort (consisting of real <m>n</m>-tuples).  In this, a <em>second course</em> in linear algebra, we will generalize this approach along two different directions: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        we will replace the specific base field <m>\R</m> with an arbitrary field (see <xref ref="d_field"/>);
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        we will consider not just vector spaces of <m>n</m>-tuples, but general abstract vector spaces. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        In this section we tackle the notion of an arbitrary field; in the next we introduce the definition of an abstract vector space. 
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="ss_complex">
<title>Complex numbers</title>
<p>
    Before getting to the abstract definition of a field, we introduce what ends up being an important example of a field: the complex numbers. 
</p>
 <definition xml:id="d_complex_numbers">
<title>Complex numbers, real and imaginary parts</title>
<statement>
<p>
The <term>complex numbers</term> is the set of all formal expressions of the form <m>a+ib</m>, where <m>a,b\in \R</m>: <ie/>, 
<me>
    \C=\{a+ib\colon a,b\in \R\}
</me>.
Given a complex number <m>z=a+ib</m>, we call <m>a</m> its <term>real part</term>, denoted <m>\Re z</m>, and we call <m>b</m> its <term>imaginary part</term>, denoted <m>\Im z</m>: <ie/>, we have 
<md>
    <mrow>\Re z \amp = a \amp \Im z\amp = b</mrow>
</md>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<convention>
    <title>Complex numbers</title>
    <p>
      When introducing a complex number as <m>z=a+ib</m>, unless specified otherwise, it is assumed that <m>a,b\in \R</m>. 
    </p>
</convention>
<p>
    You are justified in wondering what exactly is meant by a <q>formal expression</q>. A more correct formulation would be that a complex number is really just a pair <m>(a,b)\in \R^2</m> of real numbers that for various reasons we denote as <m>a+ib</m>. Since it is somewhat awkward to write a complex number as <m>z=(a,b)</m>, we will live with the ambiguity of <xref ref="d_complex_numbers"/>, and <em>identify</em> complex numbers <m>z=a+ib</m> as pairs of real numbers via the map 
    <md>
        <mrow>\C \amp \longleftrightarrow \R^2</mrow>
        <mrow>a+ib \amp \longmapsto (a,b)</mrow>
    </md>.
    To ensure that this is a well-defined bijection between <m>\C</m> and <m>\R^2</m>, we make official when two of our <q>formal expressions</q> are defined to be equal.     
</p>
<definition xml:id="d_complex_equality">
<title>Complex equality</title>
<statement>
<p>
Complex numbers <m>z=a+ib</m> and <m>w=c+id</m> are <term>equal</term>, denoted <m>z=w</m>, if <md>
    <mrow>a=c \text{ and } b=d</mrow>
</md>.
In other words, we have 
<md>
    <mrow>z=w \amp \iff \Re z=\Re w \text{ and } \Im z=\Im w</mrow>
</md>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>
<p>
    For reasons that will be made more clear below, it is natural to identify the set of real numbers <m>\R</m> with the set of complex numbers of the form <m>a+0i</m>. This is the motivation behind the next definition. 
</p>
<definition xml:id="d_real_imaginary">
<title>Real and imaginary numbers</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>z=a+ib</m> be a complex number. We say that <m>z</m> is <term>real</term> if <m>b=\Im z=0</m>, and <term>(purely) imaginary</term> if <m>a=\Re z=0</m>. Henceforth we identify the real numbers <m>\R</m> with the real complex numbers: <ie/>, we declare that 
<me>
    \R=\{z\in \C\colon \Im z=0\}=\{a+0i\colon a\in \R\}
</me>.
Furthermore we will use the following abbreviations for various real and purely imaginary complex numbers: 
<md>
    <mrow>a+i\,0 \amp =a \amp  0+ib\amp =ib</mrow>
    <mrow>a+i(-b) \amp =a-ib \amp a+i(\pm 1)\amp = a\pm i</mrow>
</md>.

    <remark xml:id="rem_complex_arith">
    <title>Complex arithmetic as extension of real arithmetic</title>
    <p>
        Using the definition of complex multiplication, it is easy to see that given any real complex number <m>a=a+0i</m>, we have 
        <md>
            <mrow>a(c+di) \amp =ac+adi=(c+di)a </mrow>
        </md>.
        In particular, given any two real complex numbers <m>a=a+0i</m> and <m>b=b+0i</m>, we have 
        <me>
            (a+0i)(b+0i)=ab+0i=ab
        </me>.
        In other words, when we restrict complex multiplication to the real complex numbers, we recover our familiar real multiplication operation. A similar statement applies for complex addition and real addition. In this sense, complex arithmetic is understood as an <em>extension</em> of real arithmetic.
    </p>
         
    </remark>
    <convention>
        <title><m>a+ib=a+bi</m></title>
       <p>
        As you will show yourself in homework, complex multiplication is commutative (<ie/>, we have <m>zw=wz</m> for all <m>z,w\in \C</m>). As a result, we are free to write a complex number <m>z=a+ib</m> as <m>z=a+bi</m>. Oftentimes one of these expressions simply looks better typographically than the other. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that when writing <m>z=a+bi</m> and <m>w=c+di</m>, where <m>a,b,c,d\in \R</m>, it is still the case that <m>z=w</m> if and only if <m>a=b</m> and <m>c=d</m>.
       </p> 
    </convention>
    
    <p>
    <xref ref="d_complex_equality"/> ensures that the map 
    <me>
        a+ib\mapsto (a,b)
    </me>
    defines a bijection between <m>\C</m> and <m>\R</m>, allowing us to identify complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. This identification in turn gives rise to a visual representation of complex numbers as points in the Cartesian plane <m>\R^2</m>, called the <term>complex plane</term> in this context. To make clear that we are using <m>\R^2</m> to visualize <m>\C</m>, we label the horizontal and vertical axes as <m>\Re</m> and <m>\Im</m>.

<p>
Using our identification 
<me>
    \R=\{z\in \C\colon \Im z=0\}
</me>,
we see that the real numbers are represented geometrically as the <m>x</m>-axis of the complex plane. Similarly, the purely imaginary complex numbers are represented geometrically as the the <m>y</m>-axis of the complex plane. As you will see, we will get a lot of mileage out of this geometric representation of complex numbers.

    It turns out that complex addition and multiplication satisfy essentially all the same useful properties as real addition and multiplication: <eg/>, both operations are commutative and associative, multiplication distributes over addition, <etc/>. As a result, arithmetic and algebra in <m>\C</m> proceeds much as it does in <m>\R</m>, making <m>\C</m> a convenient <em>number system</em> to work with. But why stop at <m>\C</m>? Are there other number systems we can build that allow us to do arithmetic and algebra in a familiar manner? Consider <xref ref="d_field"/> as an attempt to isolate precisely the properties we want a number system to satisfy in order for arithmetic and algebra to proceed essentially as it does in <m>\R</m>.

            It is clear that we can add and multiply two rational numbers; what we need to show is that the result of applying either of these operations to two rational numbers is again a rational number. In other words, we must show that the sum of two rational numbers is a rational number, and the product of two rational numbers is a rational number. To this end, let <m>r,s\in \Q</m>, and write <m>r=m/n</m> and <m>s=p/q</m>, where <m>m,n,p,q\in \Z</m>. We then have 
            <md>
                <mrow>r+s \amp = \frac{mq+pn}{mn} \amp rs\amp=\frac{mp}{nq}</mrow>
            </md>.
            Since <m>mq+pn,mn, mp, nq\in \Z</m>, we see that <m>r+s, rs\in \Q</m>, as desired. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Once we know that real number addition and multiplication restrict to well-defined operations on <m>\Q</m>, that these restricted operations satisfy the field axioms follows directly from the fact that the original operations on <m>\R</m> satisfy these axioms. For example, since addition and multiplication are satisfy Axiom (i) <em>for all real numbers</em>, they certainly satisfy Axiom (i) <em>for all rational numbers</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, the existential Axioms (iv)-(vii) are easily seen to be satisfied for the operations restricted to <m>\Q</m> once we observe that <m>0,1\in \Q</m>, and that given any nonzero <m>r=m/n\in \Q</m>, we have <m>r^{-1}=n/m\in \Q</m>.

            An argument very similar to the one in <xref ref="eg_Q"/> shows that the sum and product of two integers is again an integer, and hence that restricting these operations to <m>\Z</m> yields a well-defined operation on <m>\Z</m>.

    <li>
        <p>
            The integers fail to be a field with respect to these operations as Axiom (vii) fails. To this end, by way of counterexample, we claim that the integer <m>2</m> does not have a multiplicative inverse in <m>\Z</m>. Indeed, if there were an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>2n=1</m>, then we'd have <m>n\ne 0</m> and 
            <me>\abs{2n}=2\abs{n}=\abs{1}=1</me>.
            But for all nonzero integers <m>n\in \Z</m>, we have <m>\abs{n}\geq 1</m>, and hence 
            <me>
                2\abs{n}\geq 2\cdot 1=1&gt; 1
            </me>,
            a contradiction. We conclude that there is no integer <m>n</m> satisfying <m>2n=1</m>, and hence that <m>2</m> has no multiplicative inverse in <m>\Z</m>. Thus <m>\Z</m> is not a field with respect to these operations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As it turns out, Axiom (vii) is the only field axiom that <m>\Z</m> fails, making it still a pretty darn good number system to work with. In fact, we have a name for number systems that satisfy at least Axioms (i)-(vi) of the field axioms: they are called <em>rings</em>.

<example xml:id="eg_F2">
<title>Field of two elements</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>F=\{a,b\}</m> be a set containing two distinct elements. Define addition and multiplication on <m>F</m> as follows: 
<md>
    <mrow>a+a \amp = a \amp a+b\amp = b \amp  b+a \amp = b \amp b+b\amp = a</mrow>
    <mrow>aa \amp = a \amp ab\amp= a \amp ba\amp = a \amp bb=b</mrow>
</md>.
Verify that <m>F</m>, together with these two operations, constitutes a field. Make explicit which elements of <m>F</m> serve as the additive/multiplicative identities/inverses. 
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
Since <m>F</m> only has two elements, showing that Axioms (i)-(iii) hold is a simple matter of looking at all the possible cases: in other words, we can resort to a proof by exhaustion for these axioms. For example, verifying commutativity of multiplication requires looking at just 4 different cases. Furthermore, since it is trivially true that <m>a a=aa</m> and <m>bb=bb</m>, we need only look at the <q>mixed products</q> <m>ab</m> and <m>ba</m>; and in this case we see by the definition that
<me>
    ab=a=ba
</me>.
Similar arguments can be mounted for the rest of these arithmetic axioms. 
</p>
<p>
    We now turn to the existential axioms. First, we claim that <m>a</m> serves as the additive identity in this case: <ie/>, we have <m>0=a</m> for this field. To verify this, we need to show that <m>a</m> satisfies the defining axiom of the additive identity: namely, that <m>a+\alpha=\alpha</m> for any <m>\alpha\in F</m>. But this follows directly from the very definition of addition on <m>F</m>, as we declared that 
    <m>a+a=a</m> and<m>a+b=b</m>. A similar argument shows that the element <m>b</m> acts as the multiplicative identity in this field: <ie/>, we have <m>1=b</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    Lastly we must show that each element of <m>F</m> has an additive inverse satisfying Axiom (v), and that each nonzero element of <m>F</m> has a multiplicative inverse satisfying Axiom (vii). Again, this is accomplished simply by inspection, building on our already established result that <m>a=0</m> and <m>b=1</m>. In detail, since <m>a+a=a=0</m> and <m>b+b=a=0</m>, we see that <m>-a=a</m> and <m>-b=b</m>. Turning at last to multiplicative inverses, note first that <m>b</m> is the only nonzero element of <m>F</m> (since <m>a=0</m>). Furthermore, since <m>bb=b=1</m>, we see that <m>b^{-1}=b</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    Since the operations on <m>F</m> satisfy the field axioms, we conclude that <m>F</m> is a field with respect to these operations. Having identified <m>a=0</m> and <m>b=1</m>, we can summarize the arithemetic rules of this particular field as follows:
    <md>
        <mrow>0+0 \amp =0 \amp 0+1\amp=1+0=1 \amp 1+1\amp =0 </mrow>
        <mrow>0\cdot 0 \amp = 0 \amp 0\cdot 1\amp =1\cdot 0=0 \amp 1\cdot 1\amp =1</mrow>
        <mrow>-0 \amp =0 \amp -1\amp =1 \amp 1^{-1}\amp =1</mrow>
    </md>.
</p>
</solution>

    Take a moment to take in the exotic nature of the field in <xref ref="eg_F2"/>. Unlike <m>\Q</m>, <m>\R</m>, and <m>\C</m>, its underlying set is finite! Further peculiar attributes of this field is that every element is its own additive inverse. Crazy! Clearly, this example is important enough to warrant its own name.

        It turns out that any <em>finite field</em> (<ie/>, a field <m>F</m> with finitely many elements) has prime cardinality. In other words if <m>F</m> is finite and we can define operations on <m>F</m> satisfying the field axioms, then <m>\abs{F}=p</m>, where <m>p</m> is a prime integer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, given any prime integer <m>p</m>, we can define addition and multiplication operations on the set <m>\F_p=\{0,1,\dots, p-1\}</m> that satisfy the field axioms. In other words, for every prime <m>p</m> there is a field of <m>p</m> elements. (These are things you learn in the Math 330/331 sequences.)

<proof>
<p>
    Very much in the spirit of <xref ref="warning_names_fields"/>, when proving a result like this for an <em>arbitrary</em> field, we can make no assumptions about <m>F</m> beyond the fact that its addition and multiplication operations satisfy the field axioms. This can make the proof of these very simple properties less straightforward than you might expect. We content ourselves with a proof of (1) and (2). 
</p>
<p>
    To prove (1), we observe first that for any <m>\alpha\in F</m> we have 
    <me>
        0\alpha=(0+0)\alpha=0\alpha+0\alpha
    </me>.
    Here we have used the fact that <m>0</m> satisfies Axiom (iv) (and thus <m>0+0=0</m>), and that Axiom (iii) holds (distributivity). We conclude the proof by invoking the existence of additive inverses: in detail we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>0\alpha\amp = 0\alpha+0\alpha </mrow>
        <mrow>-(0\alpha)+0\alpha\amp=-(0\alpha)+0\alpha+0\alpha \amp (\text{add } -(0\alpha)\text{ to both sides}) </mrow>
        <mrow>  0\amp=0+0\alpha \amp (-(0\alpha) \text{ is add. inv. of } 0\alpha )</mrow>
        <mrow> 0\amp=0\alpha \amp (0+\beta=\beta \text{ for any } \beta)</mrow>
    </md>,
    as desired.
</p>
<p>
   Moving to (2), assume we have <m>\alpha\beta=0</m>. We will show that if <m>\alpha\ne 0</m>, then <m>\beta=0</m>, which is equivalent to proving <m>\alpha=0</m> or <m>\beta=0</m>. Assume <m>\alpha\ne 0</m>. By Axiom (vii) there is a multiplicative inverse <m>\alpha^{-1}\in F</m> satisfying <m>\alpha^{-1}\alpha=1</m>. But then we have 
   <md>
    <mrow>\alpha\beta=0 \amp \implies \alpha^{-1}\alpha\beta=\alpha^{-1}0</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp \implies 1\beta\beta=0 \amp (\alpha^{-1}\alpha=1, \alpha^{-1}0=0\alpha^{-1}=0 \text{ by } (2))</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp \implies \beta=0 \amp (1\beta=\beta) </mrow>
