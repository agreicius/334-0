    <title>Diagonalizable operators</title>
    <p>
      Our treatment of eigenvectors in <xref ref="s_eigenvector"/> was motivated in part by the objective of finding particularly simple matrix representations <m>[T]_B</m> of a linear transformation <m>T\colon V\rightarrow V</m>. The simplest situation we could hope for is that there is a choice of basis <m>B</m> for which <m>[T]_B</m> is diagonal. We say that the basis <m>B</m> <em>diagonalizes</em> the transformation <m>T</m> in this case, and that <m>T</m> is <em>diagonalizable</em>. In this section we develop theoretical and computational tools for determining whether a linear transformation <m>T</m> is diagonalizable, and for finding a diagonalizing basis <m>B</m> when <m>T</m> is in fact diagonalizable.

    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space. A linear operator <m>T\in \mathcal{L}(V)</m> is <term>diagonalizable</term> if there exists a basis <m>B</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>[T]_B</m> is a diagonal matrix. In this case, we say that the basis <m>B</m> <term>diagonalizes</term> <m>T</m>.

        <title>Diagonalizable matrix</title>
        <p>
            We will say a matrix <m>A\in F^{n,n}</m> is diagonalizable if its corresponding matrix transformation <m>T_A\colon F^{n}\rightarrow F^{n}</m> is diagonalizable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's examine what this means in terms of matrix arithmetic. Let <m>B=(\bolde_1,\bolde_2,\dots, \bolde_n)</m> be the standard basis of <m>F^n</m>, and recall that <m>A=[T_A]_B</m>: <ie/>, the standard matrix of <m>T=T_A</m> is the matrix representation of <m>T_A</m> with respect to the standard basis. The matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable if and only if there is a basis <m>B'</m> of <m>F^{n}</m> such that <m>[T_A]_{B'}=D</m> is a diagonal matrix. Using <xref ref="th_similarity_matrixreps"/>, this in turn is equivalent to there being an invertible matrix <m>P</m> such that 
            <me>
                D=P^{-1}AP
            </me>.
            Thus, we conclude that <m>A</m> is diagonalizable if and only if it is similar to a diagonal matrix.

        Given a basis <m>B=(v_1,v_2,\dots, v_n)</m> of <m>V</m> and linear operator <m>T\in \mathcal{L}(V)</m>, looking at the recipe for the matrix representation <m>[T]_B</m>, we see that we have <m>[T]_B=D</m> for some diagonal matrix

        for all <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>. Since vectors of a basis are necessarily nonzero, we conclude that <m>B</m> diagonalizes <m>T</m> if and only if it consists of eigenvectors of <m>T</m>. We call such a basis an <em>eigenbasis</em>.
